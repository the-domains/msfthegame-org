We all sit on the sofa or bus, watch a news clip from the other side of the world and think "that is awful," very few of us are able to find a way to make a real difference. But Doctors Without Borders are heroes who risk their own lives to save the lives of people far, far away every single day. We are making a powerful game that, just by playing, gives you, me and all of us, the chance to save lives and make a difference too. So that we can all be heroes without borders.
